## Mockito
- Let's say we're trying to test an insert method on our service layer
- Insert is going to return an id that's generated by the database
- But this id is going to be different every time because of the sequence counter
- This would make it difficult to write a unit test for because the expected output would change every time you run it
- Mockito lets us mock the data, or create "dummy" versions of it so we can make our tests consistent
- Return dummy data based on dummy input
- Set up the dummy values using when and then
    - when we call this specific method with this specific value, then we return a specific value
