## Collections
- A collection of data
- We've seen a few members of the Collections framework
    - ArrayList class
    - List interface
- Iterable - parent of the collection hierarchy
    - iterable means we can iterate through the different members
- List
    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html
    - We've seen lists being used to store different values
    - Dynamically sized, we can add elements after it's created
    - We can give it a type to indicate what classes can be in the list
        - ex: List<Pet> pets
    - There are a few different implementations of the list
    - Unordered
    - Allows Duplicate elements
    - Some methods
        - add
        - get
        - clear
        - remove
    - Classes that implement List
        - ArrayList
        - Vector
        - LinkedList
- Queue
    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html
    - Usually First in First Out
    - Methods
        - Throw Exception if fails:
            - add - insert an element into the queue
            - remove - retrieves and removes the head of the queue
            - element - return the head without removing it
        - Return special value (null or false) if fails
            - offer - insert an element into the queue
            - poll - remove the head, return null if empty
            - peek - return the head, return null if empty
- Set
    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html
    - No duplicate elements
    - Don't have a get method like list but we can use an iterator to loop through the elements in the set
    - add, remove, clear
