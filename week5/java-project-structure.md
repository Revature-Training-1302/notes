- src - where all of our source code is going to be (.java)
- main - where our "main" code is going to be, the code performs the actions that we want
- test - testing our main code, making sure that the main code is functioning properly
- java - where the Java code is, whether that be the main Java code or the test Java code
- We notice that under main and test, we have very similar structure organization
- IntelliJ helps us by color coding our folders (main java is blue and test java is green)
