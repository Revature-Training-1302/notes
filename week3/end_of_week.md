## End of Week 3
Congratulations on finishing week3, we are now a quarter of the way through training!

On Monday, we will have a QC at 11:30 EST to 1 EST. The topics will be on week 2 and week 3 (Core Java, OOP and SQL/JDBC). We will have a morning coding challenge and the rest of time before QC can be used to study. 

We will start Project 1-on-1's that afternoon and they will continue until the next morning. Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DwqpaeeQjxYECkZk-3ioR5BY_fC6G2CKBUsVIlbfvu0/edit#gid=0) to a sheet where you can sign up. Since we only have 15 minutes for our meeting, make sure to come prepared with questions that can be answered within a reasonable time and would be the most helpful. Example: "Is my package/class structure okay or could it be changed?" would be a good question because it involves a large scope of the project and it isn't a minute debugging question. 

Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, we will have a quiz on topics from week 3(SQL, JDBC). I will provide practice questions that are more geared towards QC but could also help with the quiz. As always, look through the curriculum and if there are any topics that can't explain the what, why, and how, then you know to study that topic. Make use of the questions channel, your associates, and me if you have questions/concerns!
