## Dbeaver
- Dbeaver is the platform we will use to connect to and run commands to our database:
- It is not necessary to interact with the database, it's just a visual interface
    - We can still interact with the database without DBeaver ( through the command prompt)
- Go to this [link](https://dbeaver.io/download/) and select the Windows or Mac installer and follow the instructions
- For components, you want Dbeaver Community and Include Java, 
    - Associate .SQL files optional

## Connect DBeaver to our Postgres server
- In the navar, click on "Database"
- select "New Database Connection"
- select postgreSQL as our dialect
- Click download to install drivers
- Put in our info:
    - for host, we can leave it as localhost
    - port can also be left as 5432
    - default database is postgres
    - default username is postgres
    - put in your password that you set up during the installation
- Click on "Test Connection" to make sure we're able to connect
- If the server ever stops running, use this link to restart it: https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-start-stop-restart-postgresql-server.html
