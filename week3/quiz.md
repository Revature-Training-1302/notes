- Today's quiz will be on topics from the last 2 weeks. 
- Questions are either multiple choice or True/False
- It could contain questions about topics that we didn't explicitly cover in class, but were assigned as extra reading. 
    - I assigned some articles to read on Friday (8/12), so make sure to take a look at them
- The quiz will allow for multiple attempts but only the first score will be taken into account for grading purposes.
    - The other attempts are for practice.
- The quiz is open from 5-6 EST. After this alloted time, you will be able to look back at the questions and see the correct answers. 
- If you are done with the quiz, you are free to leave for the day
