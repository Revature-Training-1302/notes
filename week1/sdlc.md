## Software Development Life Cycle
- As we develop these big projects, we usually follow certain phases

### Phases:
1. Planning - meeting with customers, Sales team, identify requirements, risks, and set up an initial plan for the project
2. Define - taking the requirements, make them more rigid and have them approved by the customer/client
3. Design - Come up with an architecture for the project, keeping in mind budget, time, robusteness, modulariy
    - Design Document Specification (DDS)
4. Build - writing the code and building the project, based on the specs that we set up during the first 3 phases
5. Test - writing tests to run the code and make sure that it produces the correct output, performs the correction actions
6. Deploy - release it to the public/client, get feedback

### Waterfall Method
- More rigid than Agile
- Sequential steps to go through the different phases
- Don't usually go back to a previous phase once completed
- Easy to understand and rigid
- Don't have working software until near the end
- Risky, because you're doing all of the phase at once, so realizing that a previous mistake contains a mistake could be very detrimental
- Difficult to measure progress

### Agile Method
- multiple iterations of a project, each one going through the different phases
- Unlike Waterfall, not working on the entire project all at once
- Flexible and adaptable, because we don't have to adhere to those pre-defined phases
- More realistic approach to the SDLC
- Promotes teamwork
- Risk of sustainability, maintability
- Risky, especially in the case of customers changing their mind
- We will learn about Scrum which is an implementatino of Agile
    - daily stand up meetings
    - sprints to complete goals
