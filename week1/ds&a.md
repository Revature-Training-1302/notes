# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures
- a way to store data
- many different options depending on what type of operations we want to perform, efficiency, size

### Arrays
- a group of values
- arrays have a size that indicates the potential space, and how many items are in the array
- in Java, arrays are statically sized, meaning we can't change the size after we create one

## Algorithms
- A series of steps to solve a problem
- Keep in mind efficiency, storage requirements
- ex: linear search, binary search
