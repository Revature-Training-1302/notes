## Debugging
- Reading Stack Trace
    - If some exception occurs, you can read the console output to try to deduce what went wrong
    - Gives line numbers and file names so you know exactly where to go
- Print-Debugging
    - A lot of steps in a program and the end result is incorrect
    - You can use print statements along the way to identify what step of the program went wrong
- Break-Points
    - Set points in the program and to pause the execution and view different variables
    - In IntelliJ you can click next to the line number to set a break point
    - Then, you click Debug *.java and the program will start
    - Pause at each breakpoint
    - Help to eliminate debugging statements
- Inspecting Code
    - Following the logic and make sure it matches what you want to happen
- Warnings are possible improvements to the code
    - unused variables - either make sure you use it or get rid of it because it has no effect
    - syntax - ex: switching from a regular for loop to an enhanced for loop
    - Not detrimental to the program but still important because they can help us improve our code
