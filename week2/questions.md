- try to get UML diagram working
	- In IntelliJ, type and hold down ctrl-alt-s to bring up the settings menu. 
	- Find Plugins on the sidebar.
	- Click on Marketplace to search for new plug-ins.
	- Search for PlantUML Parser and click install. This plugin converts our Java code to code that lets us visualize the UML diagram.
	- Search for PlantUML Integration and click install. This plugin lets us view the UML diagram based on the code that's generated by the Parser.
	- You will need to restart IntelliJ to use these new features.
	- Right-click on a package and scroll down to PlantUML Parser
	- Enter a file name and press generate.
	- Your new UML diagram should pop up!
- Look into override annotation

	- Gives a warning if the overriden method isn't actually overriding everything
	- Readbility
	From the official oracle docs, "While it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method, it helps to prevent errors"
