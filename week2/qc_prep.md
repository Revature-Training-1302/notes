Here's the topics you should make sure to know for next week's coding challenge QC:

- keeping track of variables while looping
- being able to loop a specific number of times
- being able to do something different during each iteration of the loop based on what loop number you're on

There is also a practice QC coding challenge on Revature Pro. It will be open until Sunday. It is listed as "QC Practice Coding Challenge".
