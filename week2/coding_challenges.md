## General Steps
- Read and understand the question
    - Make sure to take your time with this
    - what is the input
    - what is the output
    - general steps of how we could get from input to output
- Read in the input and print it out
    - On CodingGame, the input is usually read in for us
    - But printing it out helps me visualize our puzzle pieces
- Coming up with a solution
    - Trying to break it down into smallest possible steps
    - Don't worry about efficiency or clean code, just get something down so you can iterate on it
- Refining
    - Look at any test cases that didn't pass and see what the difference is
    - Try to make your code as generic as possible
        - Don't tailor it to one specific test case
    - Using your co-workers, online resources to ask questions
    - Some possible ideas
        - Can you sort it to increase the efficiency
- pseudo-code - code that doesn't follow syntax rules
    - rought draft of code
- ex:
``` 
for i = 0, i < 100:
    print(i)
```
