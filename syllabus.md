# Training Info
During this training I will be asking a lot of you. I will be spending several hours a day lecturing, and there will be numerous assessments, QC's, labs, assignments, and projects. Then when we get to P3 there will be the project as well as panels, portfolios, and even interviews. The next 12 weeks will be very busy and likely be very stressful. Just know that I went through this exact same curriculum as an associate. I understand the position you will be in, and I will do my best not to ask too much of you. The next 10 weeks will likely be very busy, you will be more likely to excel if you devote more time to study, preparation, and practice. However, you should fully expect to return to a normal work/life balance once the training concludes. You should not expect a culture of workaholism when working with any of our clients. The workload during training will start out heavy, and probably peak around P2 (though everyone's circumstances are unique). That said, by week 8 when you begin P3, things should start getting back to normal. 

# Business, Breaks, and Lunches
Our business week is Monday - Friday 10:00 AM EST - 6:00 PM EST. We will take an hour for lunch, and two breaks of >= 15 minutes. I will try to stick to a rough schedule every day, with a morning break, lunch at noon central, and an afternoon break. Sometimes we will deviate from this norm, however you should always get 60 minutes for lunch and two 15 minute breaks every day. The afternoon may be unstructured time, in which case feel free to take your break whenever approporiate. Our business day ends at 6:00 PM EST, you do not need to wait for me to dismiss you.

### Important: I may not be able to stay late to answer questions or assist with material after business hours. I will generally not take questions during our lunches and breaks as it's unfair to the associates who aren't present. I will do everything I can to support you throughout this program, but I can't be on the hook 24/7.

# Plagarism
I should probably devise a better word to use. The definition of plagarism we will be operating under is probably a bit different that what you might expect. I do not mind if you find code online, share it with your peers, or even copy/paste code and refactor it into your own files. The only thing that matters, is if you submit any code as part of a project, or assignment that you understand it fully and completely. If you copy and paste code from somewhere and you do not understand it, **you are plagiarizing**. The most important thing is developing an understanding of the material in this course.
  
When it comes to QC code challenges, **do not collaborate or copy/paste at all**. Think of QC like an exam. All work must be your own.

# Unstructured/Project Time
Most days I will stop lecturing in the afternoon and give you unstructured time to work on labs, study, assignments, projects, etc. I have other responsibilities as well as meetings to attend, so whenever I am not available during our business day, you will be expected to use this unstructured time wisely and productively.

# Self Study Topics
Sometimes we just won't get the time to cover all the lecture material. From time to time I may assign some topics as self study. This doesn't mean these topics are less important or can be ignored. Everything on our curriculum is important and may very likely come up in QC or panels. I will provide you with any notes or content I have.

# QC
QCs are a series of informal assessments conducted by trainers and the QC department. Every week, starting in week 2, we will have a QC of one form or another. These are most likely to be verbal assessments about topics from the previous week, though you may be asked about any and all topics covered up to that point. There are also code challenges. Take these QCs very seriously, but don't stress yourself overmuch. They are important, but they are not the only way your progress will be measured. There will be a QC orientation where you will learn more.
  
#### When it comes to QC code challenges, **do not collaborate or copy/paste at all**. Think of QC like an exam. All work must be your own.

# Projects
There will be a total of 2 projects you will all work on. We will start with Project 0, or P0, in week 1. P1, P2, and P3 will all be group projects. I will provide a document with very explicit requirements for P0-P2, and the CoE team will provide detailed requirements for the capstone project, P3.
  
Each project will be acompanied by a showcase, where everyone shows off their work. P3 will be a big presentation involving everyone, and there may be hundreds of attendees from Revature and beyond to see your work.

# Panels
Some time after week 8 you will be required to take "panels". Named for the style of the exam, a panel of experts would ask you technical and interview questions to test your knowlege and readiness for real interviews. Recently the panels have taken a new form, an online assessment. This represents the final exam, you'll learn more as the time approaches. 

# 1-on-1's
During unstructured time I will frequently be conducting 1-on-1 meetings with you and your peers. If you don't hear from me about setting up such a meeting, do not worry. These meetings are often used to discuss your individual progress, and if I don't reach out to you it just means I don't feel the need to discuss it (as in: you're doing great and I just don't have the time to tell you that). If for any reason you would like to discuss anything at all with me in a private setting, please feel free to reach out and we will schedule a 1-on-1. These can be time consuming, but I will make every effort to conduct any and all private meetings in a timely manner. It may mean we have to have our 1-on-1 during lunch or a break, but rest assured I'll give you the opportunity to make up that lost break time.

# Attendance
I will generally take attendance first thing in the morning (10 AM EST). If you're late, please let me know so I can mark you as present for the day. To get credit for the attendance, just make sure you're in the call at 10 EST with your full name as your Zoom name. 

# Dress code
### Note: Dress code applies even if we are remote. You are required to abide by the dress code every day.
- Monday - business professional
- Tuesday-Thursday - business casual
- Friday - casual

There are some exceptions to these rules, such as when presenting projects, interviewing. I will address those as they come up. 

Here is a [guide](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/guide-to-business-attire#:~:text=Business%20professional%20is%20a%20traditional,%2C%20finance%2C%20government%20or%20law.) on the different types of attire.

# Zoom Ettiquite
We will be conducting our training in Zoom. Everyone needs a webcam and microphone of sufficent quality, this is an absolute requirement. 
 - You should be ready to turn on your camera at any time if I ask. 
 - I expect everyone to have their cameras during lectures. When we break for independent time, feel free to turn them off. 
 - I don't always see all of the zoom chat, if you need something click "raise hand".
 - Everyone's mic should be muted at all times while they are not speaking. I will be muting you if you are making noise.
 - Use the "raise hand" button to get my attention. Please avoid inturrupting by unmuting and speaking. I will pause and call on raised hands as soon as possible.
 - Please do not hesitate to raise your hand and ask me about anything at all. Don't be intimidated by these bulletpoints, I want to hear from you!
 - You will be required to have your camera on during presentations, QCs, panels, and interviews.

 # Asking Questions
 I encourage/expect you to all ask questions if something is confusing or doesn't make sense. Just keep this in mind:
 - I will not always get to your question immediately, especially if I am in the middle of a demo. 
 - I will not always directly answer your question but keep in mind that this does not mean your question is invalid, stupid, or anything like that because
     - Sometimes the act of finding the answer is a good exercise, so answering directly would deprive you of the learning experience.
     - It might be irrelevant to the scope of the lesson/course. 
     - If it's a question that was already covered multiple times, I will probably just point you to when we covered it instead of spending too much time on it.
     - It might be a question to which I don't know the answer. Again, that doesn't make it a bad question, just that it's something I hadn't considered or thought of before. 
- I will sometimes set a timed limit on questions, just so we can get to all the material. I highly encourage you to ask me at a different time or rely on your fellow associates for help!

 
# Bullying
Don't do it. I expect everyone to be totally professional at all times. I have a zero tollerance policy for bullying and other unprofessional behavior. Please do not make me take action about unprofessionalism. You may not be best friends with everyone you work with, but you should be polite, courteous, and professional with everyone. If you are curious what constitutes unprofessional behavior or bullying, ask. Keep in mind, the other associates are your co-workers, and I am your supervisor. You represent Revature. Act accordingly.

# Professionalism
Please be professional at all times in the Zoom meeting, in Teams forums, and in Teams direct messages. This includes but is not limited to:
- No use of profanity
- No language that is offensive or goes against inclusivity
- Be respectful to everyone

# Final Notes
My intention of this syllabus isn't to scare anyone, but to set expectations that this will be an intense 10 weeks of learning. My sole job is to help you all and make sure you get through this course successfully and start the next step in your careers. If you've made it this far in the selection process, I have no doubt that you can make it through this course. Doing so, however, will require hard work, professionalism, team-work, and grit.
