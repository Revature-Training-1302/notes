## Agile
- Dynamic process
- Revisit parts of the development cycle multiple times before the product is finished
- Allows for communication with the client/customer along the way because they can give feedback before the project is fully completed
- Embrace change - if the requirements change, it shouldn't be too hard to apply those to the project
- Incremental Delivery - deliver pieces of the project as you go and evaluate
### User Stories
- Write out how a user would go on an use/interact with a feature
- For example, you write a log-in user story
    - User goes onto the main page, clicks on the login button on the top right. They are greeted with a form with two input boxes for username and password. The user fills out their username and password. If they are a valid user and the password is corrected, they are redirected to their dashboard. Otherwise, they will see an alert pop up that indicates their username/password is incorrect.
#### Advantages
- Relatable to humans, as opposed to using documentation with technical terminology
- Illustrates the general requirements of how that feature should work
#### Disadvantages
- Because user stories are human-readable, we might lose some details, specifity, or even some requirements
- Differences in terminology between the user stories vs the technical documentation

### Agile Refactoring
- Changing the code to be more organized, readable, etc.
    - Make use of OOP pillars
    - Removing duplicate code
    - Making variable names more appropriate

### Test First Development
- Writing tests before you write code
- Help to keep requirements in mind before writing code

### Scrum
- Implementation of Agile
- Three main phases of Scrum:
    - Initial Phase - outline objectives, give a rough architecture design
    - Sprint Cycle - incremental bursts of work on the project, determine what you want to get done, work for a cetain amount of time (1 - 3 weeks usually), iterate on your development
    - Closure Phase - wrapping up the project, writing any last documentation, preparing a presentation
