## Agile
- Dynamic process
- Revisit parts of the development cycle multiple times before the product is finished
- Allows for communication with the client/customer along the way because they can give feedback before the project is fully completed
- Embrace change - if the requirements change, it shouldn't be too hard to apply those to the project
- Incremental Delivery - deliver pieces of the project as you go and evaluate
### User Stories
- Write out how a user would go on an use/interact with a feature
- For example, you write a log-in user story
    - User goes onto the main page, clicks on the login button on the top right. They are greeted with a form with two input boxes for username and password. The user fills out their username and password. If they are a valid user and the password is corrected, they are redirected to their dashboard. Otherwise, they will see an alert pop up that indicates their username/password is incorrect.
#### Story Points
- Assigning a point-value to a user story in order to indicate how difficult it will be to complete that feature
- Think about the following:
    - Complexity
    - Amount of Work
    - Rick of change
#### Advantages
- Relatable to humans, as opposed to using documentation with technical terminology
- Illustrates the general requirements of how that feature should work
#### Disadvantages
- Because user stories are human-readable, we might lose some details, specifity, or even some requirements
- Differences in terminology between the user stories vs the technical documentation

### Agile Refactoring
- Changing the code to be more organized, readable, etc.
    - Make use of OOP pillars
    - Removing duplicate code
    - Making variable names more appropriate

### Test First Development
- Writing tests before you write code
- Help to keep requirements in mind before writing code

### Scrum
- Implementation of Agile
- Three main phases of Scrum:
    - Initial Phase - outline objectives, give a rough architecture design
    - Sprint Cycle - incremental bursts of work on the project, determine what you want to get done, work for a cetain amount of time (1 - 3 weeks usually), iterate on your development
    - Closure Phase - wrapping up the project, writing any last documentation, preparing a presentation
- Scrum Terms:
    - Development Team - the part of the team that's working on developing the code
    - Product Backlog - a list of features to be completed for the entire project
    - Sprint Backlog - a list of features to develop just for the current sprint
    - Sprint - burst of work, usually 2-4 works week long
    - Scrum Master - the person responsible for ensuring that everyone follows the Scrum process
    - Daily Standups - daily meeting where team members talk about 3 things:
        1. What they worked on.
        2. What kind of blockers/obstacles they're running into
        3. What they plan on working on next
    - Product Owner - the person who is responsible for coming up with the features that the product should have, usually the client or the customer would be the product owner
    - Potentially Shippable Product Increment - because you work on the project in sprints and increments, this terms refers to the state of the project after a sprint, product should be stable but not necessarily complete
    - Velocity - indication of how quickly a team can complete features from the backlog in a single sprint
- Trello Boards
    - Helps organize tasks into different categories
        - Product Backlog
        - Sprint Backlog
        - Completed
        - Reach/Stretch Goals
        - In Progress
        - Completed
    - Share with team-mates
    - Give tags to cards (MVP, Reach, etc.)
    - Attach developers to tasks
#### Scrum Ceremonies
- Sprint Planning
    - Planning what features to work on during the sprint
    - Goals, metrics, teams
    - At the beginning of the sprint, take place for about an hour per week
- Daily Scrum/Daily Stand-Up
    - Each team meets and gives progress, blockers, and next steps
    - Each team leader would then meet with the scrum-master and relay all the relevant information to the other team leads as well as the scrum master
- Sprint Review - 
    - Summarize the successes/failures of the sprint, give feedback
    - Might include demos of the project so far
    - 45 minutes at the end of the week
- Sprint Retro - 
    - Talking about the Scrum process, thinking about how anything could be compared
    - 45 minutes at the end of the week
