## CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets
- We define the look, style, colors, formatting of our web page


### Different ways to apply CSS stylings
- External - you put stylings in a file with the .css extension
    - import into the HTML file
    - The best practice, because they're in separate files, they can be reused all over the project
- Internal - define your CSS stylings within the HTML document
- Inline - define your stylings right in the element
    - The worst practice because if you have inline styles, they take the most precedence so they can overwrite changes made in other places
- CSS styles have keys and values
```css
color: red;
font-size: 20px;
```
